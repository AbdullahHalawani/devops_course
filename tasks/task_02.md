# Task 02

1. Try doing [Task 01](tasks/task_01.md) _without having to use the file from the local filesystem_.

   - You can use `curl` and pipes `|`, or
   - Try storing the file into an env var with `curl` instead of downloading it everytime

2. List all the packages installed on your machine.
3. List all the commands you used `grep` in.
4. Install docker.
5. Get the IP (v4 or v6) for one of google's mail server; Can you do it with one command?
