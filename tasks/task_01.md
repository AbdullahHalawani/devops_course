# Task 01

## Problem Statement

You have a file [grades.csv](../data/grades.csv) that contains GPAs for a lot of students

- First Name
- Last Name
- University
- GPA

To download the file to your linux server, use `wget`:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saedx1/devops_course/main/data/grades.csv
```

Using that file, write one-line commands to get answers to the following questions:

1. How many students are their?
2. Show the unique universities?
3. How many universities are their?
4. How many universities have the word `University` in them.
5. Show the top 5 students based on their GPA.
